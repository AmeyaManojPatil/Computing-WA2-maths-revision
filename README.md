hello mr lam my project is very unfinished.
Inspiration: I made this web app as i thought that it was an interesting idea because i could continue to use this to revise maths in the future.
What it does: Users can register(optional) and login and then attempt the maths questions, specifically vectors 1 questions.
How i build this: I used Flask to make this web app and connected it to a SQLite Database, and used html and css for the web pages.
challenges i ran into: debugging the code became increasingly hard as the lenght of it kept on increasing so it was quite challenging to solve errors. Another challenge was that the SQLite database was not connecting multiple times.
Accomplishments that im proud of: One thing in my web app that im proud of is that i found how to calculate the time taken to finish a question and tell the user whether they were fast enough.
What i learnt: i revised a lot of Flask and python, along with html and css and now feel more confident writing Flask. Moreover, i learnt how to connect a database to my web app.
Whats next for my maths revision site: The code for logging in and registering is quite buggy and hence i would fix that. In the database, there is a "QuestionsCount" column which i intended to make a leaderboard of where users will be ranked by the total number of questions they completed. Furthermore, i only made one question for vectors 1 and did not make questions for other topics as i did not spend enough time working on this, therefore i would add a lot more question types.
